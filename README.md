# Inner Foundation

Welcome to the official repository for the Inner Foundation website. Inner Foundation provides 1-on-1 coaching for founders and engineers in crypto, helping them develop stronger foundations to navigate their challenges with our experience in crypto, proven coaching techniques, practical psychology, and systems thinking.

## Overview

Our website reflects our philosophy at Inner Foundation: coaching is about finding the core issues, maintaining focus, and inspiring actionable steps. Coaching is about the client's needs over the coach's prominence. 

With this philosophy in mind, we designed and implemented it ourselves with HTML, CSS, and vainilla JavaScript, devoid of unnecessary complexity. We designed the website to be clear and functional without sacrificing personality and taste. It aligns with the principles of the 512KB Club‚Äîto be precise, our site weighs under 100KB.
