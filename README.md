# Inner Foundation

Welcome to the official repository for Inner Foundation's website. Inner Foundation provides 1-on-1 coaching for founders and engineers in crypto. We help them develop stronger foundations to navigate the inherit challenges of building and scaling projects. Our approach blends our experience in crypto, proven coaching techniques, practical psychology, and systems thinking.

## Overview

Our website reflects our philosophy: coaching is about the client's needs over the coach's prominence. Coaching is about finding the core issues, staying focused, and taking actionable steps. 

With this philosophy in mind, we designed and implemented the site ourselves with HTML, CSS, and vainilla JavaScript, removing unnecessary complexity. We designed the website to be clear and functional without sacrificing personality and taste. The whole site runs under 100KB.
