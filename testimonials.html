                    <p class="testimonial-text">"Mon helped me stay grounded through one of the toughest periods of my career. While living in a stressful and constantly changing environment, full of noise, tight deadlines, and significant responsibilities, she continuously guided me to learn more about myself, keep my emotions in balance, understand my past, and clarify my mind so I could make thoughtful and confident decisions. The practices I learned with her are tools I still use today. This work isn't a one-time experience, but something you can carry with you for the rest of your life."</p>

                    <p class="testimonial-text">"Coaching helps you build a complete picture of your personal and professional life. It's like a personal audit, helping you discover the real causes of problems and potential solutions. Coaching is probably the action with most mid-term ROI for organizations and for yourself as an executive. With Monica, I discovered lots of hidden patterns that kept me from my optimal professional balance. When we solved them, I felt liberated from a personal point of view, and the career growth I've experienced has been spectacular."</p>

She became an indispensable companion with whom I could trust, challenge, be challenged and reflect upon from another perspective. Most importantly, in my constantly evolving role at a fast-moving start-up, she strove to continually re-understand my personal situation to stay effective in widening my awareness and bringing clarity to new situations."</p>

                    <p class="testimonial-text">"Before coaching, I felt unproductive and stuck. Through the coaching process, I was able to pinpoint what was holding me back and unlock it. Coaching is a mental health tool, with a purpose and objectives that serve you as an individual, professionally and personally. Monica helped me unlock my full potential and effectiveness, guiding me through the steps needed to complete my coaching with results that were truly satisfying."</p>

She helped me stay consistent without feeling pressured, made me reflect in a super friendly way, and helped me bring out the best version of the leader I am. I realize that many of the things we learned together have become a permanent part of who I am. I also loved that her approach is a mix of emotion, business, and science. She shares her presence and her intellect in equal measure, plus tons of reference links to books and videos to keep expanding on the concepts from the sessions. They were incredibly useful. She's like a walking library of resources for becoming the best version of yourself. A mini-Yoda for founders! Thanks, Monica, for your help!"</p>

                    <p class="testimonial-text">"I've always prided myself on being independent and solving challenges on my own until I discovered Moni's Magic. She has been more than just a coach; she's become a trusted person and an invaluable business advisor. She quickly grasped my personal and professional context and tailored her coaching methods to suit my preferences, incorporating tools like Miro, building my Notion dashboard, communicating through WhatsApp and constantly adapting to my needs through role-play exercises. Something I'm extremely grateful for is how Moni is always available, and we've found that asynchronous feedback is a highly effective tool for tackling on-the-go challenges. Her support has been instrumental in my journey as an entrepreneur. If you are looking for someone to be accountable of your process and get high quality insights, try some Moni Magic!"</p>

                    <p class="testimonial-text">"Sessions with Monica are like seeds; as you plant them, dedicate time, and water them, they allow you to grow alongside them. Through questions and reflections, Monica has helped me identify the mindsets that do not bring me closer to where I want to be, and define my identity. Thanks to Monica's guidance, I have learned to identify what I need at each moment, how I can achieve it, and what I can take on. With her help, I am developing my own method of decision-making and setting realistic future scenarios. Moreover, we are working on breaking down my goals into phases and executable tasks, understanding that it is a process and that the most important result might not be the final goal. Thanks to her, I now ask for help when I need it and effectively delegate what I consider necessary to focus on what truly deserves my attention."</p>
